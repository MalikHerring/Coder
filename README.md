OVERVIEW:

 This program opens a GUI for you to enter a phrase and have
 the characters shifted to encode it and shift them back to decode it.


INCLUDED FILES:

 * PhraseCoder.java - driver file
 * PhraseCoderPanel.java - source file
 * PhraseCoderCL.java - command line version source file
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 After download double click the icon or right click and select run

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 This is very simple. You put the shift number you would like to encode
 the phrase with into the shift box. You press encode and give that code
 to someone else with the shift number. They then input the same shift number
 and press Decode giving them the original message.

TESTING:

 Testing this software was a lot of mental work and trial and error. For the
 most part I was able to do do this in one sitting with a slight problem when
 having brain farts.

DISCUSSION:
 
 When testing the program I ran into an issue of it saying null at the
 beginning of the string. I learned that I did not initialize the input
 and output strings.
